/*Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates,
 you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.*/
/*We don’t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features
 in React without rewriting existing code.*/
 //React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.

/*React components implement a render() method that takes input data and returns what to display. This example uses an XML-like syntax called JSX.
 Input data that is passed into the component can be accessed by render() via this.props.*/

/*JSX is optional and not required to use React.
 Try the Babel REPL to see the raw JavaScript code produced by the JSX compilation step.*/
/*In addition to taking input data (accessed via this.props), a component can maintain internal state data (accessed via this.state). When a component’s state data changes,
 the rendered markup will be updated by re-invoking render().*/
