# Project Discription

Continuous learning is an essential topic in the modern world. However, most people find
difficulties when finding learning opportunities due to various reasons. The Most common
reason is unawareness about available opportunities due to the lack of communication between
educational opportunity providers and opportunity seekers.
Providing quality education for a reasonable price or free is also essential. However, it is
challenging for the organizations due to the unavailability of funds and volunteers for ongoing
projects.

Edu Share is a web-based solution designed to resolve the mentioned problems by connecting
educational opportunity providers and the seekers via a community.
By using this system, Organizations can publish their available educational opportunities and
the projects that require financial aid and volunteers. Moreover, regular users will be able to
find suitable educational opportunities and will be able to donate or contribute to the ongoing
projects of an educational organization.
